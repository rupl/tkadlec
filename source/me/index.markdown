I'm an independent web developer, consultant and trainer living in northern Wisconsin with my wife and three daughters.

I'm very passionate about the Web and can frequently be found [speaking](http://timkadlec.com/talks) about what I've learned at a variety of web conferences.

I wrote [Implementing Responsive Design: Building sites for an anywhere, everywhere web](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com) (New Riders, 2012) and was a contributing author for the [Web Performance Daybook Volume 2](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Performance-Daybook-Volume-2/dp/1449332919). You can find me sharing my thoughts in a briefer format on Twitter at [@tkadlec](http://twitter.com/tkadlec).

Formerly, I was the co-founder of [Breaking Development](http://bdconf.com), one of the first conferences dedicated to web design and development for mobile devices. I also hosted [the Breaking Development Podcast](http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast), a weekly podcast with a very similar focus (really, it was just an excuse for me to talk to people far smarter than I every week).
