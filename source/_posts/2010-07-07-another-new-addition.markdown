A short week ago (June 30th), my wife and I were lucky enough to welcome our second healthy baby girl into the world. Just like her big sister, Jessica Claire weighed in at a healthy 8 lbs 15 oz.

Her big sister, thankfully, thinks Jessica is at least somewhat interesting so far and likes to come and "talk" to her. Both girls, as well as their mother, are doing well (if not a bit tired).

I'm sure there's going to be plenty of barbies and tea parties in the future (heck, there's already some "Ring Around the Rosie") but I'm sure I won't mind. I'm just a happy dad whose two little girls have him firmly wrapped around their fingers.
