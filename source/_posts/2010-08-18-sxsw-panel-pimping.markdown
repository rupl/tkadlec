The SXSW panel picking madness started last Wednesday. After attending the conference twice, I finally got around to submitting a talk this time around. If you're interested in web performance, neuroscience, and in particular how those two areas intersect, feel free to [give it the old thumbs up](http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/5726). Either way I'll be attending (already registered and got the flight and hotel booked) but I'd love to get the opportunity to <del>hear myself talk</del> share some information while I'm there as well.

Enough self promotion. After having taken a look through the options, here's a few more talks that I'm really hoping make the cut. Again, if they sound interesting to you, please give them a thumbs up in the PanelPicker.

If any of you have a panel submitted, or came across one particularly interesting, feel free to let me know. I know many people frown upon the annual "panel pimping" but I actually enjoy it. There are quite a few panels I probably wouldn't have heard about otherwise.
