For the third year in a row, my book count is trending in the wrong direction. In 2009, [it was 38](http://timkadlec.com/2010/02/what-i-read-in-2009/). In 2010, [it was 33](http://timkadlec.com/2011/01/what-i-read-in-2010/). In 2011, that number [fell to 29](http://timkadlec.com/2012/01/what-i-read-in-2011/) and this past year, that number plummeted to 21.

Not only do I think reading is important, but it's also something I enjoy a bunch and probably the closest thing I have to a hobby. However this year the reality is that I just didn't set aside much time for reading. Whereas I used to read at least 30 minutes each night before bed, this past year I spent that time [writing my own book](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com) and doing a large number of side projects in preparation for starting to work independantly. 

There was a point while writing my book that I just didn't feel like I had the energy to read anything substantial, which is why there is a pretty heavy increase in the number of fiction books this year. I also read a very unusually small number of non-industry related non-fiction, something I plan on remedying next year. 

Also of interest, at least to me, was that this was my first year with a Kindle. I had been a paper holdout for a long time, and still enjoy a good paperback or hardcover book from time to time. The Kindle's influence on my reading is noticeable though. Of the 21 books read, a whopping 17 of them were read on the Kindle.

I've found the Kindle really boosts the number of impulse reads. The advantage is that I read things (like Monoculture and Wool) that I probably would have not seen otherwise. The disadvantage is that my count of "started to read but haven't finished" has never been higher.

As with every year, if the book made the list below then I enjoyed it on some level—life is too short to waste time on bad books. For fiction, it's hard to beat Wool and I love me some Patrick Rothfuss (I also have to admit that I enjoyed the Hunger Games much, much more than anticipated). 

For non-fiction, Design is a Job is my top choice. It's a book that I honestly wasn't very excited for, but given how solid the A Book Apart series has been, I thought I'd give it a go anyway. I'm glad I did. Smart, funny, helpful—it's just a fantastic read.
