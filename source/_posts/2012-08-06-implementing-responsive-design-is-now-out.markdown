As of today, I no longer have to say "I'm working on a book…". [_Implementing Responsive Design: Building sites for an anywhere, everywhere web_](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com) is officially in-stock on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Responsive-Design-Building-everywhere/dp/0321821688/) as well as at [Peachpit](http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321821688) (Barnes & Noble is a hair behind, [it would seem](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/implementing-responsive-design-tim-kadlec/1110854574?ean=9780321821683)).

This all means that there are already people reading the ebook, and others will have the paperback within the next couple of days. This is both terrifying and exciting.

As I stated [back in January](http://timkadlec.com/2012/01/im-writing-a-book/), the book is an exploration of how a responsive approach applies to your entire workflow. It starts with a few chapters laying down the groundwork: media queries, fluid layouts and fluid images. Then it builds from there and talks about how responsive design affects planning, design workflow, content, and how to build introduce feature detection and server-side enhancements.

I'm very happy with the result. Proud even. The early reception has been great, and the fact that so many people who I admire and respect have had such nice things to say means a ton to me. I've posted a few quotes from some of them on the [book site](http://www.implementingresponsivedesign.com/#reviews) and I'll try to add more soon.

I know it's not the most popular section of the book, but I wanted to re-post the acknowledgements below because without all the help provided by so many people, this book wouldn't have happened.

I hope you guys enjoy the book!


## Acknowledgements

It is frequently said that writing a book is a lonely, solitary act. Perhaps that is true in some cases, but it certainly wasn’t the case with this book. If this book is any good, it’s because of all the hard work, patience and feedback provided by everyone who helped along the way.

I owe a huge thank you to...

Michael Nolan, who invited me to write a book in the first place. Thanks for being willing to gamble on me.

Margaret Anderson and Gretchen Dykstra for overlooking my horrible misuse of punctuation and for generally making it sound like I know how to write much better than I do.

Danielle Foster for making the book look so fantastic, and putting up with a few last minute adjustments. Also, to Rose Weisburd, Joy Dean Lee, Aren Straiger, Mimi Heft, Rebecca Winter, Glenn Bisignani and the rest of the team at New Riders for helping make this book come to life.

Ed Merritt, Brad Frost, Guy Podjarny, Henny Swan, Luke Wroblewski, Tom Maslen and Erik Runyon for their incredible contributions. By being willing to share their expertise and experiences, they’ve made this a much richer book than it would have otherwise been.

Jason Grigsby for making sure I wasn’t making things up along the way and for providing valuable (and frequently hilarious) feedback and encouragement throughout. Not only is Jason one of the smartest people I know, but he’s also one of the most helpful. I’m thankful to be able to call him a friend.

Aaron Gustafson for writing such a great foreword. I’ve been learning from Aaron since I first started working on the web—to say I’m humbled and honored that he agreed to write the foreword is an understatement.

Stephen Hay, Stephanie Rieger, Bryan Rieger, Brad Frost, Derek Pennycuff, Ethan Marcotte, Chris Robinson, Paul Thompson, Erik Wiedeman, Sara Wachter-Boettcher, Lyza Danger Gardner, Kristofer Layon, Zoe Gillenwater, Jeff Bruss, Bill Zoelle, James King, Michael Lehman, Mat Marquis, Nishant Kothary, Andy Clarke, Ronan Cremin, Denise Jacobs and Cennydd Bowles for the insights, feedback and encouragement they provided along the way. This book owes a great deal to their collective awesomeness.

To everyone whose conversations, both in person and online, inspired the discussion that takes place in this book. This is an awesome community we have going and I’m proud to be a part of it.

My mom and dad for their love and words of encouragement throughout.

My lovely daughters for reminding me it was ok to take a break every once in awhile to play and for filling each day with laughs, kisses and hugs.

And my incredible wife, Kate. This book, and anything else I do that is any good, is a direct result of her loving support and encouragement. There are no words powerful enough to express how thankful I am for her.
