Yesterday we released the very first episode of the [Breaking Development Podcast](http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast). I’m super excited about this! Much like the [conference](http://bdconf.com), the podcast will focus on web design and development for mobile and beyond. It's primarily going to be interview based, but we'll probably also shake it up every once and awhile and do something a little different.

A podcast seemed like a really fun idea. It’s an awesome time to be working on the web, and there are so many fascinating discussions to be had. The way I see it, the best case scenario is that people will like the show, listen, and keep coming back for more. The worst case scenario is people won't like it, but I'll be able to use it as an excuse to talk to super smart people on a regular basis about topics that interest me. I really don't see a downside here.

The first episode features two guests: [Erik Runyon](http://twitter.com/erunyon) from the University of Notre Dame and [Dave Olsen](http://twitter.com/dmolsen) from West Virgina University. They’ve both been doing some awesome responsive work for their respective universities. We talked a lot about why and how they’ve implemented responsive design on their sites, how they're both using RESS, whether user agent detection is evil, designing in the browser and lots of other good stuff.

[Give it a listen](http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast/mobile-web-in-higher-ed) and let me know what you think. If you enjoy it, a [kind word on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/breaking-development-podcast/id553491521) would be incredibly helpful. Solid reviews on iTunes are one of the best ways to help others find out about the podcast.

And stay tuned—we already have several more shows lined up with some awesome guests and topics. If you've got any suggestions, [drop me a line](mailto:tim@timkadlec.com)!
