Far too many projects and marketing campaigns today start by answering the question "What value does this have for our company?" The question shouldn't center around the company, the question should center around the users. What we should be asking is "What value does this have for our users?"

It's a very simple concept, but it is one that, if adhered to, would fundamentally alter the priorities of a project. If the user comes first, SEO takes a backseat to content strategy. Accessibility and performance cease being afterthoughts and become crucial components of a site. More time is given to user research to determine what users expect to find on your site, and where they expect to find it.

The irony is that by putting the users first, the success of the project would greatly be improved. Build something that users care about and want to use and they'll reward you with their loyalty.

Imagine if every company took the time to ask, and more importantly to answer, this question before launching their projects. Wouldnâ€™t that be refreshing?
