On June 14th, I'm going to teach a one-day [Implementing Responsive Design workshop](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com/workshops.php) at the McNamara Alumni Center in Minneapolis. The workshop will run the full day and will go from the core tenants of responsive design through to more advanced topics such as performance optimization, feature detection, RESS and more. We'll cover topics from the book, as well as a loads of new stuff.

I want to keep it relatively small, so attendance is going to be limited to 30 people. That way everyone should have ample opportunity to ask questions and contribute to the discussion. The workshop is intended to be a bit flexible and include topics that you want to see covered.

Registration for the complete day is $350 and opens, well, [now](https://timkadlec.wufoo.com/forms/implementing-responsive-design-workshop). Parking will be covered, and breakfast, lunch and coffee will be provided. In addition, thanks to [Peachpit](http://peachpit.com/), everyone who attends will get a copy of [Implementing Responsive Design](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com) to read, sell, or use as a doorstopâ€”your choice.

To see more details or to register, please have a peek at the [workshop page](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com/workshops.php).

Hope to see you in June!
