Yesterday the last of the topics for [Breaking Development](http://breakingdc.com) was announced. I couldn’t be happier with how it all turned out! I think there’s an [awesome mix of talks](http://breakingdc.com/topics) that are going to really challenge people to reconsider how they approach mobile development.

Also, since last I wrote about the event, we added a special [half hour talk by Brian Alvey](http://breakingdc.com/topics#alvey). Brian has a ton of experience managing the content for some major mobile applications and I think his talk on mobile and the cloud is going to be a great addition to the lineup.

In addition to the topic selections, we’ve been spending a lot of time lately figuring out how to handle the food (I think we’ve got something both unique and cool lined up for that!) as well as the bevy of other little details that go into getting a conference up and running.

There are still tickets available and we’ll be selling them right up to, and at, the door. As a reminder, the pass includes attendance for both days (13 talks) as well as admittance to the opening night party and lunch, breakfast and snacks on both days. [Hope to see you all in April!](https://www.breakingdc.com/register)
