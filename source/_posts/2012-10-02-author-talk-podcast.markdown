Nancy Ruenzel over at Peachpit was kind enough to have me on her "Author Talk" podcast. We chatted a bit about [the book](http://implementingresponsivedesign.com), responsive design in general, and [Breaking Development](http://bdconf.com).

Go ahead and [give it a listen.](http://www.peachpit.com/podcasts/episode.aspx?e=16c7d568-7350-4f06-a78a-8d2f24b6ba6b)
