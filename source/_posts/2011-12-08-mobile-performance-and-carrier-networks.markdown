I always look forward to the December return of the all the lovely advent blogs that are full of web goodness. Sites like [24ways](http://24ways.org/), [PHPAdvent](http://phpadvent.org/2011) and the [Performance Calendar](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/) mean that I'll have something to look forward to reading each day. So I was very excited when [Stoyan](http://www.phpied.com/) asked if I would like to write another post for the Performance Calendar this year.

This year's post is an overview of how inconsistent mobile networks are, as well as a plea for more communication between carriers, manufacturers and developers. If you're interested in mobile performance, please [give it a read](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/carrier-networks-down-the-rabbit-hole/).

Be sure to check out the rest of the articles there as well. As usual, there's lots of good content already posted with more sure to come. In particular, I recommend Stoyan's post on [asynchronous snippets](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/the-art-and-craft-of-the-async-snippet/), [Guy's](http://www.blaze.io/) look at [when you should and shouldn't inline resources](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/why-inlining-everything-is-not-the-answer/), and a post on [localStorage performance](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/localstorage-read-performance/) by [Nicholas](http://www.nczonline.net/).
