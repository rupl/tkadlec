It's April. The weather is starting to get nicer, Easter is around the corner...and hundreds of people are going streaking! No, you don't have to be nervous about heading outside today. This kind of streaking is completely un-offensive (hopefully). Once again it's time for the annual CSS Naked Day.

CSS Naked Day is a way of promoting web standards by stripping off all the CSS on a site to show that by structuring your HTML in a way that is semantic and makes sense, your content is still useful even without all the pretty design. If you want more information, you can check out the official [CSS Naked Day site](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/), and the almost 400 participants.

Don't worry, this site will return to its regular design and layout on the 10th.
