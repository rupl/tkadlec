So, I'm writing [a book on responsive enhancement](http://responsiveenhancement.com) for New Riders.

To say I'm excited is a bit of an understatement. I love sharing what I know, and writing a book has been something I've wanted to do for a long time. I'm not sure of the exact publication date yet, but it looks like the book should be out sometime in the second half of the year.


## Uh...there’s already an awesome book on responsive web design


Why yes, there is, and I wholeheartedly recommend buying a copy. Like, [now](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design). Ethan’s book is a brilliant read. I even wrote a [glowing review](http://timkadlec.com/2011/06/book-review-responsive-web-design/) shortly after finishing it. In that review, I said I was pining for a sequel—something that would build on the core principles Ethan discussed. When Michael Nolan of New Riders got in touch a few months ago and asked if I was interested in writing a book, I saw it as an opportunity to get that book written.


## More info, please!


The book will be an exploration of how a responsive approach can be integrated into the workflow—from planning and early mockups through to the actual development of the site. In addition to fluid layouts, media queries and fluid images, the book will discuss topics such as design deliverables, structured content, feature detection and server-side enhancements.

If you want to keep up with the progress, your best bets are to follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/tkadlec), stay tuned to this blog, and sign up for the mailing list at [responsiveenhancement.com](http://responsiveenhancement.com).

I’ll keep you posted!
