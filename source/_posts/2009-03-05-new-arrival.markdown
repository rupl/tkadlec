Things have been a bit silent around here lately, but I feel for a pretty good reason.

As many of you who are on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Tim-Kadlec/208201515) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tkadlec) no doubt already know, on February 7th my wife and I had our first child, a little baby girl. Little is a bit relative here...Naomi Adalyn was an ounce shy of 9 lbs and was 21" long. I wanted to get this post up a bit earlier, but as you can probably guess, she's kept us quite busy.

She's very healthy, and both my wife and I are very happy (and a little tired!). Hopefully as we continue to get accustomed to our new schedules, I can get back to fairly regular postings.
