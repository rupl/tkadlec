Congratulations! You have managed to stumble across my first attempt at having a personal site. While the site is admittedly a bit short on content right now, my goal is for this to eventually turn into a fairly interesting place to visit on a regular basis. Be patient, Rome as they say, was not built in a day.

What can you expect...well, there will be many conversations about what I have learned or come across in the world of web development. In particular, you should eventually see information on things like CSS, XHTML, Javascript, and so on.

There will be some personal updates mixed in I am sure, but I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of posts will be informative and educational in nature.

This is a custom built blog system, so if anything is quirky, or some feature that you feel is seriously important is not here (other than pretty permalinks, they'll be coming soon), please feel free to [let me know](mailto:tim@timkadlec.com).

So stay tuned and hopefully I will have something a little more interesting to read for you soon.
